%% CONVENTIONS (for naming BibTeX citation keys)
%%
%% Books are tagged by the first author's last name, a colon, up to 3
%% upper-case letters taken from the first three upper-case words in the
%% title (ignoring words like A, And, The), followed by the last two digits
%% of the publication year.  If there is a volume entry, it is appended to
%% the tag, prefixed by a hyphen.

%% Below is a description of all fields recognized by the standard
%% bibliography styles.  An entry can also contain other fields, which
%% are ignored by those styles.

%% address
%%
%% Usually the address of the publisher or other type of institution.
%% For major publishing houses, van Leunen recommends omitting the
%% information entirely. For small publishers, on the other hand, you
%% can help the reader by giving the complete address.

%% annote
%%
%% An annotation.  It is not used by the standard bibliography styles,
%% but may be used by others that produce an annotated bibliography.

%% author
%%
%% The name(s) of the author(s),
%% in the format described in the \LaTeX\ book.

%% booktitle
%%
%% Title of a book, part of which is being cited.  See the \LaTeX\
%% book for how to type titles.  For book entries, use the title field
%% instead.

%% chapter
%%
%% A chapter (or section or whatever) number.

%% crossref
%%
%% The database key of the entry being cross referenced.

%% edition
%%
%% The edition of a book---for example, ``Second''.  This should be an
%% ordinal, and should have the first letter capitalized, as shown
%% here; the standard styles convert to lower case when necessary.

%% editor
%%
%% Name(s) of editor(s), typed as indicated in the \LaTeX\ book.  If
%% there is also an author field, then the editor field gives the
%% editor of the book or collection in which the reference appears.

%% howpublished
%%
%% How something strange has been published.  The first word should be
%% capitalized.

%% institution
%%
%% The sponsoring institution of a technical report.

%% journal
%%
%% A journal name.  Abbreviations are provided for many journals; see
%% the Local Guide.

%% key
%%
%% Used for alphabetizing, cross referencing, and creating a label
%% when the ``author'' information (described in Section
%% odds-and-ends) is missing.  This field should not be confused with
%% the key that appears in the \cite command and at the beginning of
%% the database entry.

%% month
%%
%% The month in which the work was published or, for an unpublished
%% work, in which it was written.  You should use the standard
%% three-letter abbreviation, as described in Appendix B.1.3 of the
%% \LaTeX\ book.

%% note
%%
%% Any additional information that can help the reader.  The first
%% word should be capitalized.

%% number
%%
%% The number of a journal, magazine, technical report, or of a work
%% in a series.  An issue of a journal or magazine is usually
%% identified by its volume and number; the organization that issues a
%% technical report usually gives it a number; and sometimes books are
%% given numbers in a named series.

%% organization
%%
%% The organization that sponsors a conference or that publishes a
%% manual.

%% pages
%%
%% One or more page numbers or range of numbers, such as 42--111 or
%% 7,41,73--97 or 43+ (the `+' in this last example indicates pages
%% following that don't form a simple range).  To make it easier to
%% maintain Scribe-compatible databases, the standard styles convert a
%% single dash (as in 7-33) to the double dash used in \TeX\ to denote
%% number ranges (as in 7--33}).

%% publisher
%%
%% The publisher's name.

%% school
%%
%% The name of the school where a thesis was written.

%% series
%%
%% The name of a series or set of books.  When citing an entire book,
%% the the title field gives its title and an optional series field
%% gives the name of a series or multi-volume set in which the book is
%% published.

%% title
%%
%% The work's title, typed as explained in the \LaTeX\ book.

%% type
%%
%% The type of a technical report---for example, ``Research Note''.

%% volume
%%
%% The volume of a journal or multivolume book.

%% year
%%
%% The year of publication or, for an unpublished work, the year it
%% was written.  Generally it should consist of four numerals, such as
%% 1984, although the standard styles can handle any year whose last
%% four nonpunctuation characters are numerals, such as about 1984.
